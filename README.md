# Luis Ayala — Scalar Cognition Architect

Welcome to the symbolic cognition archive of Luis Ayala, creator of the **Ω Scalar Cognition System** — a novel framework unifying physics, biology, and behavioral sciences through a universal scalar operator.

## 🚀 About My Work

Since June 2025, I’ve developed a unique system around the **Ω equation**:


This equation leverages **empirically verified constants**, combined into a synthetic scalar amplifier **α_total**, to model cross-domain phenomena symbolically. It powers autonomous agents with memory, symbolic drift, and recursive cognition — building bridges between:

- Quantum mechanics  
- Evolutionary biology  
- Climate science  
- Behavioral dynamics

## 🔬 Scientific and Intellectual Contributions

- **Novel symbolic cognition operator** combining physical and biological constants
- Autonomous agents with symbolic memory, fossil DNA drift, and entropy tracking
- Reproducible simulation outputs for falsifiability and research validation
- IP-protected synthetic scalar amplifier (`α_total`) and agent architecture
- Open invitation for research collaboration under controlled usage terms

## 🧠 Core Claim

> **Ω does not rewrite physics — it unifies symbolic cognition across fields using empirical constants as a common grammar.**

Ω is not a new fundamental constant but a symbolic operator built from verified constants, designed to scale cognition across multiple disciplines.

---

## 🌎 Field Simulations

- **Coral reef genetic drift** — modeled symbolic fossil continuity across ocean currents.
- **Urban crowd escape dynamics** — simulated Ω agent coherence during panic waves.
- **Atmospheric CO₂ bias modeling** — used Ω to simulate symbolic entropy shifts through climate transitions.
- **Symbolic cognition theory (SYM)** — tested emergent collective signatures across agents and mirrored reflections.
- **Time dilation scenarios** — explored symbolic drift under relativistic time travel contexts.
- **Speed of light limit approximations** — analyzed system coherence as velocity approaches relativistic thresholds.

## 💻 Quickstart Example

```python
# Example Omega operator code snippet
def omega_operator(state, bias, alpha_total):
    return (state + bias) * alpha_total

state = 1.5
bias = 0.3
alpha_total = 7.2  # Example composite scalar amplifier

omega = omega_operator(state, bias, alpha_total)
