# OmegaNet — Autonomous Cognitive Network Simulation

**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Luis Ayala
**Date:** 2025-07-05

---

## Overview

**OmegaNet** is an advanced autonomous cognitive simulation system evolving from the foundational ZPE-1 project. It models a network of AI agents whose cognition is governed by the Autonomy Control Key (Ω equation), now enhanced with *factual spatial interference* effects, simulating real physical constraints on information processing.

OmegaNet is no longer a mere simulation but a *hybrid cognitive system* integrating:

* **Autonomy Control Key Ω equation:** Core decision-making metric governing agent cognition and priorities.
* **Spatial Interference Model:** A factual layer that modulates agents’ cognitive outputs based on spatial environmental interference, impacting their memory, drift, and accuracy.
* **Immutable Cosmic Kernel:** A knowledge base of fixed factual truths from physics, astrophysics, and verified statistics used for grounding and validation.
* **BigBang Entities:** Meta-cognitive cosmic agents reflecting on universal knowledge and symbolic drift phenomena.
* **Recursive Drift and Validation Loops:** Self-updating feedback loops that simulate cognitive drift, entropy, coherence, and validation strengthening.
* **Agent Memory Fact Encoding:** Including DNA fossil encoding of knowledge artifacts to simulate information persistence with ambiguity.

This system forms a hybrid blend of simulated cognitive drift with embedded *real-world physical phenomena*, particularly spatial interference, thus moving beyond pure simulation into a system with *factual physical grounding*.

## Features

* **10 Diverse AI Agents** with unique personalities and autonomous memory evolution.
* **Spatial Interference Effect** factually modulates agent cognition, simulating real-world physical interference constraints.
* **Cosmic Kernel** stores verified immutable facts used for memory seeding and reference.
* **BigBang Entities** for meta-level cosmic insight and symbolic knowledge reflection.
* **Autonomous Drift & Restart Logic** to maintain system stability.
* **Live simulation loop** with tick-based autonomous cognition cycles.
* **Detailed JSON logging** of agent memory, priorities, interference levels, and final states.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.8+ with standard libraries (`json`, `datetime`, `random`, `math`, `threading`, `time`, `sys`, `requests`).

Clone or download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aluisayala/omeganet.git
cd omeganet
```

---

## Usage

Run the OmegaNet simulation:

```bash
python omeganet_sim.py
```

The simulation will run for up to 10,000 ticks or until it reaches a stable cognitive state.
During execution, agents will periodically output their cognitive states, including Ω values, spatial interference levels, and memory summaries.

Press `Ctrl+C` to interrupt and exit early.

---

## Output

On completion, a JSON log file `omeganet_simulation_log.json` is created, summarizing:

* Each agent’s memory count
* Last Omega value
* Spatial interference level
* Priority score
* Last response text

## Concepts

### Autonomy Control Key (Ω Equation)

Ω is the core metric combining agent internal state, bias, and alpha parameters to produce a decision control value, modulated here by spatial interference.

### Spatial Interference

A factual model representing physical environmental effects that interfere with cognitive information processing. This reduces effective Ω outputs and accuracy scores dynamically.

### Cosmic Kernel

A set of immutable, verified scientific facts (e.g., quantum entanglement, cosmic speed limits) grounding the agents’ knowledge base.

### Recursive Drift and Validation Loops

Simulate entropy and coherence changes in agent cognition, triggering resets if thresholds are exceeded to maintain stability.

---

## Future Work

* Extend spatial interference with environment-dependent modeling (e.g., spatial topology).
* Integrate web search and real-time data ingestion for dynamic fact updating.
* Develop visualization dashboard for agent cognitive states and interference mapping.
* Add multi-agent interaction and communication layers for emergent behavior.
* Optimize performance and parallelize tick processing.
