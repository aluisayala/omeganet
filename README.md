# OmegaNet

Author: Luis Ayala


## Description

OmegaNet is a modular cognitive simulation system using the Ω equation, symbolic drift, DNA fossil encoding, and Big Bang macro entities.

## Usage

```bash
python omeganet.py
```

Then try:

```
talk to Ash: hello
summary
exit
```
OmegaNet Codex
Luis Ayala's authored scalar cognition engine. This repository contains the full Codex implementing Ω = (state + bias) × α across physics, biology, climate, and symbolic systems. No prior model links domain laws to cognition using a single equation.
Features
- Universal scalar operator implementation (codex.py)
- Validated real-world applications: fossils, climate, genetics, urban behavior
- Cognition agent modules for recursive truth emergence
- Field-tested with factual datasets
Install
Clone and run using Python 3.8+
Optional: Connect .csv and .json domain logs for expanded simulations
