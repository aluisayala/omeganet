# Luis Ayala — Scalar Cognition Architect

Welcome to the symbolic cognition archive of Luis Ayala, creator of the **Ω Scalar Cognition System** — a novel framework unifying physics, biology, and behavioral sciences through a universal scalar operator.

## 🚀 About My Work

Since June 2025, I’ve developed a unique system around the **Ω equation**:


This equation leverages **empirically verified constants** combined into a synthetic scalar amplifier, **α_total**, to model cross-domain phenomena symbolically. It powers autonomous agents with memory, symbolic drift, and recursive cognition — building bridges between:

- Quantum mechanics  
- Evolutionary biology  
- Climate science  
- Behavioral dynamics
