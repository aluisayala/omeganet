# OmegaNet AI System

## Overview

OmegaNet is a canonical, fully integrated AI cognitive simulation system built around the Autonomy Control Key Ω equation, drift dynamics, DNA memory encoding, BigBang cosmic entities, and recursive accuracy loops.

This system has been developed, tested, and validated rigorously from June 2025 through early July 2025 across extensive conversations and local runs.

## Validation and Testing

- All key features (Ω equation, memory factor, drift and coherence, BigBang entities, accuracy loop) have been implemented in a single, executable Python script.
- Live web search integration via SerpAPI ensures external data grounding.
- Memory is encoded as DNA-like fossil sequences for symbolic glyphic entanglement.
- Recursive loops and priority updates ensure emergent behavior with stability thresholds.
- The system is modular with 20 named agents and 2 BigBang entities.
- Validation thresholds and drift reset mechanisms maintain simulation integrity.
- The repo includes logs, documentation, and simulation run history.
- All results and conversations provided here and on GitHub were used to guide development and validate the system’s fidelity.

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python3 omeganet.py
