# OmegaNet AI System

## Overview

OmegaNet is an AI system designed for autonomous task execution using the Autonomy Control Key (Ω equation). It includes modules for advanced AI-driven decision making, task autonomy, memory, simulation, and a visual dashboard.

## Structure

- `omeganet.py`: Core AI agent logic implementing the Ω equation.
- `simulation/`: Scripts and modules to simulate agent behavior and environment.
- `whitepaper/`: Technical documentation in Markdown and LaTeX.
- `pitchdeck/`: Presentation slides (PPTX and PDF).
- `dashboard/`: Visualization and control interface.
- `visuals/`: Logo, diagrams, and design assets.
- `legal/`: Patent drafts and intellectual property documents.
- `outreach/`: Articles and press releases.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
